## The Autonomous Vehicle Challenge

{% include image-gallery.html images="course.jpg" height="400" %}

We competed in an autonomous vehicle challenge where our robot had to
navigate through the obstacle course depicted above. Each team was 
free to design their robot's hardware and software however they wished, 
as long as the robot was completely autonomous. 

## Design Approach


## Results

We competed on this obstacle course at two competitions. At the first event,
the obstacle course was outdoors and uncovered. **The video above** illustrates
how sun exposure corrupted our robot's camera images. As a result, our robot 
failed to complete the course.

**However**, at the second event, the obstacle course was built on an outdoor,
covered tennis court. Our robot performed much better under these lighting
conditions, and **our team won first place.** The **video above** shows the winning
lap.
