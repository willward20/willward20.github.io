# Motivation
Mobile robots driving in off-road environments face rapidly changing terrain conditions that affect their motion and control. Traditional models often fail when encountering new or unseen surfaces, leading to poor performance or collisions. Therefore, real-time adaptation is critical for safe and reliable navigation.
