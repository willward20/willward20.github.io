# Research Problem
Mobile robots driving in off-road environments face rapidly changing terrain conditions that affect their motion and control. Traditional models often fail when encountering new or unseen surfaces, leading to poor performance or collisions. Real-time adaptation is critical for safe and reliable navigation.
